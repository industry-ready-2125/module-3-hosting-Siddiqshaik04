        Coffee Board appointed Andhra Pradesh Girijan Cooperative Corporation Limited (GCC) for promoting coffee
        plantations in the valley through local tribal farmers.[clarification needed] In 1985, the plantations were
        handed to A.P. Forest Development Corporation and GCC promoted Girijan Coop. Plantation Development Corporation
        (GCPDC) exclusively to develop coffee plantations in tribal areas. All the plantations developed by GCC and
        GCPDC were handed over to the tribal farmers at two acres per family.[6] Apiculture farms have been widely
        spread in Araku, several types of flavoured honey is being made commercially.</p>
